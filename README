Project Description
The goal is to develop a machine learning model for hate speech  Prediction, to potentially replace the updatable supervised machine learning classification models by predicting results in the form of best accuracy by comparing supervised algorithms. The main Scope is to detect the hate speech, which is a classic text classification problem with a help of NLP and machine learning algorithm. It is needed to build a model that can differentiate between hate speech or not.
